# A bit About the project

## My first NextJS site

First and foremost, I learned a LOT from this project. As my first NextJS project, got to see the nuances of the framework, its limitations, and of course its strengths.

## Hindsight is 20/20

Looking back, I can see a lot of ways to improve upon what I built here to save time, increase scalabity, and optimize performance. Over time I'm hoping to come back and refactor some of the problem spots and see if I cant continuously make it better as I learn more.

## From a design perspective

Looking at it from the eyes of a designer, I'm pretty pleased how it turned out. The brand feels strong, modern, and yet relaxed and the logo is responsive and multifaceted. If I was to adjust anything in the design it would probably be the light blue color. I feel it can use minor adjustments.
